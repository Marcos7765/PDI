## DCA0445 â€” Processamento Digital de Imagens Assignments

### File structure

Each `exercicio_*` folder correspond to an assignment at 
link:https://agostinhobritojr.github.io/tutorial/pdi/tarefas.html[this page] (by the time of writing ofc), with an
blog-like report at http://marcos7765.github.io/PDI/ (in Portuguese).

`docs/` contains all html generated by asciidoctor-multipages aswell as the assets used by them.
`utils` contains third-party dependencies and (maybe) some common code to many exercises.

### General execution

First, be sure to have set-up all dependencies listed on `utils/README.md`. To reproduce the results obtained (as close
as possible), create a `build` folder inside the `exercicio_` folder you want to reproduce, execute `cmake ../` and
follow it with `make` to compile every executable of the assignment. To know how to use each program, you can
execute `./<PROGRAM_NAME> -h` (it also prints a short description of the program). The minimum stdc++ version hasn't
been tested, but stdc++17 was enough (gcc's default right now).

To build the site, just use `make` in the project root folder.
